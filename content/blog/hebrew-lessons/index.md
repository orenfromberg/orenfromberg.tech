This is an app I created several years ago when I was teaching Hebrew school over zoom. It allows teachers to have interactive instruction with kids as they take turns reading the hebrew letters, words, and phrases.

## [Click Here for Hebrew Lessons](/lessons)

Instructions:
1. Select a Lesson from the dropdown at the top of the screen.
2. Add your students names
3. Click `Next Challenge` or `Random Challenge` to present a challenge to a student

Optionally:
* you can pass onto another student using the `Let another student try` button
* Click `Display Cheatsheet` to show the Hebrew letters and vowels

בהצלחה!

(good luck!)
