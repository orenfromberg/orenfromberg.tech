Strength training is a necessity.  Without constant exercise I can feel weakness returning to my soul. 

My fitness goal is to live a long healthy life without injury. I want to avoid chronic pain and disease as much as possible. 

Being an active mountain biker means I need the strength to hit and overcome obstacles in my path. These obstacles cause sudden motions that can jerk my body with a lot of force. Having strength allows my body to withstand these motions and absorb the shock.

I frequently dedicate time to my goal of getting stronger. Since I follow the Strong Lifts plan, I tend to work out every 2-3 days which gives my muscles time to heal and recouperate.
