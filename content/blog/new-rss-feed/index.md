An RSS feed, which stands for Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary, is a standardized format for delivering regularly updated web content. It allows users to subscribe to websites, blogs, news sources, and other online publications and receive automatic updates whenever new content is published. RSS feeds are typically in XML format and provide information about the content, such as the title, summary, publication date, and a link to the full article or post.

This website now publishes an RSS Feed to the [rss.xml file here](/rss.xml).
